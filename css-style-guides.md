# CSS Methodologies 
###### because I’ll be damned if I work on another project with bad CSS (that isn’t my fault)
http://patternlab.io/ - Atomic CSS (CSS should be broken down into “atomic” components, which are grouped together and used to build modules)

https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/ - BEM (Naming convention for CSS elements. Promotes a simple, flat, and descriptive hierarchy”)

http://warpspire.com/kss/ - KSS (Documentation style and tool for CSS. Can be used to automatically generate styleguides)

https://smacss.com/book/categorizing - SMACSS (Very broad. Not sure I’m a huge fan, but I’m putting it here because why not?)

http://www.sitepoint.com/atomic-oobemitscss/ - A cool article explaining how all of these concepts can come together in a project
