Project Overview
========
This document acts as a home for omnipresent project goals and information for \<Title Pending\>.

\<Title Pending\> is part of a student-driven overhaul of how version control is taught in the IGM curricula. \<Title Pending\> is a starting ground for students to learn version control, with resources to start versioning code using Git. It is designed to ease the introduction of version control into early course material by professors, serve as a solid starting point for students new to the concept of versioning, and contain a collection of resources to continue exploration of the world of source control. 

Goals
-----
This project aims to address the lack of substantial version control education in the IGM program curricula. Instead of trying to do what others have done better, the goal to create an informative web resource that can act as a useful starting point for students and introduction tool for professors for the importance of version control. The importance of ease of inclusion by professors is as prime a concern as its usefulness for students. Lastly, the open source nature of the project will serve as an additional teaching tool as students curious to explore further will be able to look at this project for guidance.
