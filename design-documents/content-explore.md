# Content Links

These links will be at the bottom of the page and be separated into three categories: "Try", "Learn", and "Start". "Try" links are resources that allow anyone to learn how to use a VCS through example and practice by typing the commands. "Learn" links are resources that go above and beyond simple documentation by explaining how things work in accessible language. "Start" links are resources that can serve as starting points for anyone to continue their interest into the realm of exploration and practice by using the thing in practical situations. The majority of "Start" links will be hosting services, but not all of them. The links that will occupy these categories are as follow:
